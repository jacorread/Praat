#Purpose: close copy stylization according to the IPO model of Intonation.
#The script requires a point tier marked with the value of each pitch movement and a sound file with the same name. 
#Output: a new sound object with stylized pitch contour

# TextGrid data
form Info
	natural tier 1 
	natural duration 3.0
endform 

#Select Textgrid
textgrid$ = selected$ ("TextGrid")
	select TextGrid 'textgrid$'

npoints = Get number of points... 'tier'

#Create pitch tier
	pitch_ID= Create PitchTier: "newpitch", 0, 'duration'

for i to npoints
	select TextGrid 'textgrid$'
	point_time = Get time of point... 'tier' 'i'
	pitch_value = Get label of point... 'tier' 'i' 
	selectObject: pitch_ID
	Add point: point_time, pitch_value	
endfor 

#Resynthesis

select Sound 'textgrid$'
manipulation_ID = To Manipulation: 0.01, 75, 600
	selectObject: pitch_ID
	plusObject: manipulation_ID 
Replace pitch tier
	selectObject: manipulation_ID
Get resynthesis (overlap-add)
